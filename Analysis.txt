** apps earn $5000 a month per app store regardless of the app price.

** need to find apps that are BOTH tables to make the most money... $10,000 a month -- and App Trader would prefer to work with apps in BOTH stores anyway.

** 	A. App trader will purchase apps that are 10,000 times the price of the app. Keep with apps that are free - $1.

	B. Apps that are in both stores is ideal since they will double profit at $10,000 monthly versus $5,000
	
	C. App trader will spend on average $1000 a month to market an app regardless of the price of the app. $200,000 cost of an app or $1 - both will cost $1000 in marketing

	D. Ratings of the app is important for longevity of the app. 0 rating - 1 year usage. 1 rating - 3 years. 4 rating - up to 9 years. App store ratings - AVG of the scores from BOTH app stores and 	rounding to the nearest 0.5.	

	E. App trader would prefer apps that are in BOTH stores since they can market both for the same $1000 per month.
